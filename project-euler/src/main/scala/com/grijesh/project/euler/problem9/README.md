###The following problem is taken from Project Euler.
<p>
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,<br/>
a^2 + b^2 = c^2<br/>
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.<br/>
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.<br/>
Find the product abc.</p><br/>
