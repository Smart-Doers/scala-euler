###The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

<p>
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,<br/>
<br/>
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385<br/>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,<br/>
<br/>
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025<br/>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.<br/>
<br/>
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
